                <p><strong class="hello">Hello!</strong> My name is Jahdai Bruno. Before you take a look at my portfolio 
                    I'd like you to get to know more about the person behind this creation.
                    I was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona, 26 years old, and am happily married; 
                    going on 6 years this October of 2023! Some of my hobbies include hiking, playing 
                    video games, and photography. I enjoy spending time with all my loved ones (that's 
                    including my two dogs), health and fitness, and music. Currently working at Amazon as 
                    a logistics coordinator III, I received the opportunity to enroll in a program for software
                    development. This page is to showcase what I have learned. It will continue to 
                    improve overtime the more I learn. My career goal is to work in the field of technology.
                    My top motto is don't stop until you figure it out. My second is never give up. Thank you for your view and enjoy!
